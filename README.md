This is a award points calculator created in a React framework [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I've also created a simple API for generating random transactions.

Main logic is in logic/getAwards.ts file.

For fetching transactions I've created useTransactions.ts hook in apiCalls

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

API route can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/transactions](http://localhost:3000/api/transactions).
